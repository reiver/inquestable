Inquestable
===========

Inquestable is a *domain-specific language* (DSL) designed to make it easier to create tests to test humans.

For those who come from the world of *software engineering*,
inquestable is a tool and programming language for creating *unit tests* and *integration tests* that you "run" on humans.
This could be something a teacher or instructor would want to "run" on his or her students.
Or it could be something to "run" on new employees as they are going through the on-boarding process.

Note that none of this guarantees that, if a human gets all the answers correct on a test,
that that human will have the (objective) correct understanding.
If the test is enforcing something that is *not reflective of reality*, then that humans understand may end up being not *not reflective of reality* too.
Garbage in, garbage out.
So you have to make sure your tests *reflect reality* (assuming that is what you are going for).
